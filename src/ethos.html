    <p>Over the years this term, <em>Form follows function</em> has been attributed to many Designers and Architects, although was originally coined by Louis Sullivan in 1896. Simply put, this means that something created should work first and then become beautiful.</p>

        <h2>HTML first</h2>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundations of the web. HTML was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee">Sir Tim Berner-Lee</a> as a way of connecting documents together and since that day, back in 1990, this has been the way that websites and online services work.</p>
        <p>HTML is an incredibly smart language and has been built to be backwards compatible, what this means is that any site, service, portal will work on any browser in the world, even those built by Tim in 1990.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>If you are building a site that can’t be accessed by everyone whether with a disability or lack of funds or low grade technology, as far as I’m concerned you can get in the bin!</p>
        <p>After all, as Sir Tim said, <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552">This is for everyone.</a></p>
