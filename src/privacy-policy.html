<h3 id="pr-01">Why we value your privacy</h3>
<p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.</p>
<h3 id="pr-02">How we collect information</h3>
<p>We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry.</p>
<p>Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don’t use analytics or native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.</p>
<h3 id="pr-03">What information we hold</h3>
<p>When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and the company you work for, if you’ve given us that.</p>
<p>If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.</p>
</ul>
<h3 id="pr-04">Where we store your information</h3>
<p>When you contact us by email or through our website, we store your your information in our customer spreadsheet. If we do business, we store your information in our accounts software, Freeagent. We chose these systems partly for their commitment to security.</p>
<h3 id="pr-05">What we use your information for</h3>
<p>We will use your information to contact you about the projects we work on together.</p>
<p>We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.</p>
<h3 id="pr-06">Who’s responsible for your information at our company</h3>
<p>Dave Letorey, our Director, is responsible for the security of your information. You can contact them by email at <a href="mailto:hello@code-red.uk?subject=Security%20Issue">hello@code-red.uk</a> if you have any concerns about the information we store.</p>
<h3 id="pr-07">Who has access to information about you</h3>
<p>When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access.</p>
<h3 id="pr-08">The steps we take to keep your information private</h3>
<p>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.</p>
<p>The computers we use are all encrypted using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837">FileVault</a> and are protected by a passcode. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.</p>
<h3 id="pr-09">How to complain</h3>
<p>We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we handle your privacy, please contact Dave Letorey by email at <a href="mailto:hello@code-red.uk?subject=Security%20Issue">hello@code-red.uk</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pr-10">Changes to the policy</h3>
<p>If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.</p>
