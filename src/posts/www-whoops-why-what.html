<section><p>So the World Wide Web, often shortened to <abbr title="World Wide Web">www</abbr>, became a thing in 1989, and since then many people/companies/organisations have been prefixing their website <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URLs</abbr> with <abbr title="World Wide Web">www</abbr>. Even though nobody ever buys <samp>www.my-website-name.com</samp>, they would purchase <samp>my-website-name.com</samp>, and the <samp>www</samp> part is a subdomain of the domain.</p>

<h2>Whoops</h2>
<p>It is reported that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web#WWW_prefix" title="www prefix on Wikipedia">the www was a mistake</a>. It was originally meant to refer to the World Wide Web project page at CERN <span lang="fr">(Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléair)</span> and info.cern.ch was meant to be the home page for CERN, although the DNS records were never switched. Subsequently many organisations followed suit and www became the norm.</p>
<h3>Douglas Adams</h3>
<p>Douglas once quipped:</p>
<blockquote><p>The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it’s short for</p><cite>Douglas Adams <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_%22www%22">www pronunciation</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>This is because World Wide Web has 3 syllables and double-u double-u double-u has 6.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>So why do people/companies/organisations use www in the <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr> of their site, well simply because that's how the first site did it.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>What, should you do?</h2>
<p>Well, technically, really it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The way I think of it is what do you say out loud when you tell someone the URL of your site, I say - <em>code-red.uk</em> (that's <em>code dash red dot uk</em>). I, personally, would never say <em>double-u double-u double-u dot code dash red dot uk</em>.</p>
<h3>How to decide?</h3>
<p>Well if you're a company or organisation that has created loads of printed and digital materials, with either www or non-www then choose that way, the important thing to do is create the redirect on your web server.</p>
