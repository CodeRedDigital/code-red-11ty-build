  Why a11y? A11y is a numeronym, presenting "accessibility" as "a" followed by
  11 more letters, followed by "y".

<h2>… Screen Readers</h2>
<p>
  For a great many people when you talk about accessibility, they instantly
  think about Screen Readers. While Screen Readers are an important tool for
  those that have an impairment there are many other ways a user can be
  affected.
</p>
<h3>Hearing</h3>
<p>
  You might think that reading a web page isn't going to affect hearing, but in
  today's modern web has rich media including video and audio. Subtitles and
  Captioning can help with this, I believe this should be mandatory. If
  Subtitles or Captions are not possible or appropriate a Text Description can
  help, this will also help with those on slow networks or less with data.
</p>
<h3>Visual</h3>
<p>
  The majority of people think that Screen Reader users are blind. This is just
  not true, in fact the majority of blind people actually have some sight. The
  best thing that we can do for Screen Readers are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the correct <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> elements</li>
  <li>Write semantic HTML</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/landmarks/index.html" title="W3C Aria Landmark Roles examples">Aria Landmark Roles</a></li>
  <li>Use large text</li>
  <li>Consider contrast ratios of text and background</li>
</ul>
<h4>Colour Blindness</h4>
<p>
  Colour Blindness affects about 8% of all men and 0.6% of women and comes in many different types, the 3 main ones are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deuteranopia (common)</li>
  <li>Protanopia (Rare)</li>
  <li>Tritanopia (Very Rare)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I use a tool called
  <a href="https://colororacle.org/" title="Color Oracle App">Color Oracle</a>
  for testing my web pages for colour blind users, you should consider looking
  at what your site looks like for user with Colour Blindness. You can also get contrast score in the browsers dev tools.
</p>
<h3>Dexterity</h3>
<p>
  Not all of our users have the ability to use a mouse to navigate a web page,
  some of them have fat fingers. While not actually a disability it does make it
  difficult to hit small targets close together on touch devices.
</p>
<p>
  Dexterity is about making your site easy to use for those with accuracy
  problems. Having small buttons makes it difficult to target with a mouse,
  especially if the elements are not laid out semantically.
</p>
<p>
  At work I use a mouse as little as possible, opting for Keyboard Shortcuts and
  tabbing through forms and I’m frequently disappointed.
</p>
<p>The best things we can do for users with dexterity problems are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code>:focus</code> styles - this is not hard and you probably already have <code>:hover</code> styles, although these may not be appropriate</li>
  <li>Use the correct HTML elements</li>
  <li>Write semantic HTML</li>
  <li>Don't re-order elements with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></li>
  <li>Never mess with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex" title="Mozilla Developer Network article on tabindex">tabindex</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Cognitive</h3>
<p>
  This affects a user's ability to understand. The issue most associated with
  this is dyslexia. Making the content easy to read and understand, without
  using complex terms. Using sans serif fonts are easier to read, users who have
  severe dyslexia will often override your stylesheets with their own. The
  British Dyslexia Association has a fantastic
  <a href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/common/ckeditor/filemanager/userfiles/About_Us/policies/Dyslexia_Style_Guide.pdf" title="BDA Style Guide">Dyslexia Style Guide (PDF)</a>.
</p>

<h2>… Guidelines</h2>
<p>
  There are guidelines that help us to check our sites for accessibility issues.
  These, as the name suggest, are a guide and only following a set of predefined
  checkpoints doesn't mean that your site is truly accessible, it means that you
  passed those checkpoints.
</p>
<p>
  Saying that, they can still be a good guide. There is a great tool called <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe</a>, that I use regularly.
</p>
<h3>Section508 (1194.22)</h3>
<p>
  While this standard covers all areas of a11y there is a section of it,
  <a
    href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/guide-to-the-section-508-standards/web-based-intranet-and-internet-information-and-applications-1194-22"
    title="section508 1194.22"
    >1194.22</a
  >, which covers Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications.
  The rest of the standard covers areas such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Software Applications &amp; Operating Systems (1194.21)</li>
  <li>Telecommunication Products (1194.23)</li>
  <li>Video &amp; Multi-media Products (1194.24)</li>
  <li>Self-Contained, Closed Products (1194.25)</li>
  <li>Desktop &amp; Portable Computers (1194.26)</li>
  <li>Functional Performance Criteria (1194.31)</li>
  <li>Information Documentation &amp; Support (1194.41)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The bulk of 1194.22 has not been updated since 2001, a time when the web we
  created was a very different beast. In fact, some of the recommendations I
  looked at talk specifically about table-based layouts. This got me thinking
  about perhaps it’s about time that the US should consider using, WCAG, the
  same standard used by the rest of the world and recommended by W3C. Further
  reading/research led me to discover that the United States Access Board, 18
  January 2017, published a
  <a
    href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/overview-of-the-final-rule"
    title="Overview of section508 final Rule"
    >Final Rule</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The Final Rule, outlined the changes that were to be made to section508. The
  main one, affect those who build websites and web-based applications, is
  Incorporation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). This came
  into effect as of 18 January 2018. This is a great leap forward for a11y in
  the US, many of the sites that I tested last week, using HTML CodeSniffer, for
  section508 would highlight the occasion error or warning. When testing the
  same sites against WCAG AA, they would highlight considerably more errors or
  warnings.
</p>
<h3>WCAG</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag" title="Introduction to WCAG"
    >WCAG</a
  >
  is a more universal standard, created by the W3C's WAI (Web Accessibility
  Initiative). WCAG is a standard that originates from 1999 (WCAG 1.0), the WAI
  have just released the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/" title="Candidate Release for WCAG 2.1">First Public Working Draft for WCAG 3.0</a>.

<h2>… For the disabled people</h2>
<p>
  Making sites accessible for those with accessibility issues is great UX and
  make our sites better for all. The argument, "we don't have blind users on our
  site", just does not wash. You have no idea what impairments your users have
  or how they're interacting with your site. Google Analytics can tell us many
  things about our users, but can't tell if they are using a screen reader,
  keyboard, mouse, braille keyboard to interact with our sites.
</p>
<p>There are many times when a11y helps normal users:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Due to my dyslexia I often get my computer to read long blog posts to me
  </li>
  <li>
    With old age comes:
    <ul>
      <li>Dexterity Issues</li>
      <li>Hearing Issues</li>
      <li>Visual Issues</li>
      <li>Cognitive Issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When I have no headphones on public transport, captions help me watch videos
  </li>
  <li>Captions can also help with strong accents</li>
  <li>
    While drunk/intoxicated, an easy to read/simple site can aid
    understandability
  </li>
  <li>
    If a right-handed person breaks their arm and has it in a cast using a mouse
    or touch device becomes more difficult.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive" title="Microsoft Inclusive Design">Microsoft Inclusive Design site</a>, is a fantastic resource, especially their Inclusive Toolkit Manual, for understanding Permanent, Temporary and Situational disabilities. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ninjanails">Seren Davies</a>, added a Cognitive section to their Inclusive Toolkit Manual.
