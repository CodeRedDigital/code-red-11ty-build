    <h2>Hello Mike, from the future</h2>
    <p>This is not really a post from the future, but it is used to solve a problem.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>On the blog listing, I wanted to show a different number of posts on the first page (8) than the rest of the pages (9). <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, the Static Site Generator I used to build this site, doesn't have a nice way to do this.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <h3>Future Post (aka this one)</h3>
    <p>I created a post that has a future date, of 1st January 2500.</p>
    <pre>

    <h3>Filter out the future post</h3>
    <p>In order to do this I check if the posts date is <em>not</em> 1st January 2500.</p>
    <pre>
&lcub;&percnt; if item.data.date != "2500-01-01" &percnt;&rcub;
  code that I want goes here
&lcub;&percnt; endif &percnt;&rcub;
    </pre>
    <h3>Set a reminder to update in 2500</h3>
    <p>As I may want to post an article on 1st January 2500, I have set a calender reminder to fix this hack in the future.</p>

    <h2>Why 'Hello Mike…'</h2>
    <p>Well it was my good friend Mike that came up with the original idea for solving this:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I would approach this by having a dummy entry in whatever data you're paginating, either at the start or at the end, which has a property set to say that it should not be displayed. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hack?src=hashtag_click">#hack</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eleven_ty">@eleven_ty</a></p>
