    <p>This week <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk" title="Daft Punk's wikipedia page">Daft Punk</a>, the French electronic music duo, announced that after 28 years in the music industry they were to split.</p>
    <p>They did this via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDX6wNfjqc" title="Daft Punk's Epilogue video">a video called Epilogue</a> on their YouTube channel.</p>
    <p>But how does Daft Punk relate to the Web?</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Robots rock</h2>
    <p>Daft Punk, were commonly known via their Robot personas. Similarly websites also need a Robot to be discoverable.</p>
    <p>To be more precise a <code>robots.txt</code>. This is a text file that lives at the root of a website that tells machines what to look for on  the site and what not to look for.</p>
    <p>In this file we tell the bots of the web what they are <em>allowed</em> and <em>disallowed</em> from seeing or indexing (storing for them to display).</p>
    <p>These bots are referred to as <strong>User-Agents</strong> and we can target all of them together with a wildcard <code>* (asterisk)</code>, or naming them individually.</p>
    <p>Here is the <a href="/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> for this site, below I shall explain what is going on.</p>
    <pre>
User-agent: Twitterbot
Allow: /images/

User-agent: facebookexternalhit
Allow: /images/

User-agent: *
Sitemap: https://code-red.uk/sitemap.xml
Disallow: /images/
    </pre>
    <p>First of all I am telling the Twitter and Facebook's bot that it is OK to go ahead and look at all the files in the <code>/images/</code> folder.</p>
    <p>Secondly I m using the <code>*</code> (wildcard) to target every bot and tell them where my <a href="/sitemap.xml"><code>sitemap.xml</code></a> is located. I then <code>Disallow</code> them all from indexing all files in the <code>/images/</code> folder</p>
</section>

    <h2>Humans after all</h2>
    <p>Daft Punk, were of course not robots, they were Humans after all. Just like websites are not created by robots they are created by humans.</p>
    <p>We can add a <code>humans.txt</code> file to the root to show who are the real people that have worked on, contributed, help on a site.</p>
    <p>While there is no requirement or standard for creating a <code>humans.txt</code>, <a href="http://humanstxt.org/">http://humanstxt.org/</a> has some guidelines on what you might include. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Team</li>
        <li>Technologies</li>
        <li>Thanks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some companies will use it to advertise jobs too.</p>
    <p>Below you can see the <a href="/humans.txt">humans.txt</a> file for this site.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Daft Punk were an amazing part of music history and there music has not gone away, they just won't be making anymore. I don't think this is that bad a thing as they'd been dormant for a while and perhaps now they will make more music on solo projects.</p> 
    <p>In order to make your site discoverable, you'll need a <code>robots.txt</code> file.</p>
    <p>In order to show appreciation for those working on your site you should include a <code>humans.txt</code> file.</p>
