<h2>Before I start</h2>
<p>So last month I decided that it was, after over 15 years of web development, about time that I learnt JavaScript properly.</p>
<p>To do this has decided to use 3 resources:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" title="Introduction to JavaScript on Codecademy">Codecademy - Introduction to Javascript</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://javascript.info/" title="JavaScript Info Website">JavaScript.info</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://beginnerjavascript.com/" title="Beginner JavaScript by Wes Bos">Wes Bos - Beginner JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I choose these for a number of reasons, the first two are free to take online, although you can pay Codecademy for a Pro version that gives you access to more content. Beginner JavaScript is a paid for course by <a href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes Bos</a>, Ive&nbsp;&nbsp;previously bought two of his other courses (<a href="https://es6.io/" title="ES6 for everyone course by Wes Bos">ES6 for Everyone</a> &amp; <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/" title="React for Beginners by Wes Bos">React for Beginners</a>), I paid for this because I know that my learning style is best when someone is explaining it to me, and Wes does a great job of doing this, plus I can rewatch the videos over and over. Learning styles are important and you can find out <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/quiz-item.asp" title="How to Study - Learning Style Assessment">your learning style</a> by doing an online quiz.</p>

<h2>Quotes in JavaScript</h2>
<p>There are 3 different quotes that can be used in JavaScript to declare strings, settings, etc. They are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Single quotes - <code>'</code></li>
    <li>Double quotes - <code>"</code></li>
    <li>Backticks - <code>`</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues with quotes</h3>
<p>It's easy to declare a variable in JavaScript:</p>
<pre>const myVariable = "Whatever I set this to";</pre>
<p>This is all good until you want to set a string with double quotes within it:</p>
<pre>const myVariable = "Dave said: "Hello World"";</pre>
<p>What happens here is the second <code>"</code> , just before Hello closes this string and we will get an error <code> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier </code> .</p>
<p>This can easily be solved by using ' (single quotes) to declare the variable string with the double quotes within them:</p>
<pre>const myVariable = 'Dave said: "Hello World";'</pre>
<p>This is great and works until our string contains an apostrophe:</p>
<pre>const myVariable = 'Dave's friend said: "Hello World"';</pre>
<p>This time the apostrophe in Dave's stops the string and we again the same error <code> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier </code> .</p><p>Again there is a way to fix this by escaping the internal quotes, escaping is done by placing a backslash before the quote:</p>
<pre>const myVariable = 'Dave\'s friend said: "Hello World"';</pre>
<p>With the advent of ES6 in 2015 we can now also use <code>`</code> backticks. This means that there will be less need to escape as backticks are just much less used.</p>
<pre>const myVariable = `Dave's friend said: "Hello World"`;</pre>
<h3>Other advantages of <code>`</code> backticks</h3>
<h4>Multi-line strings</h4>
<p>While multi-line strings can be created without <code>`</code> backticks, by escaping the end of the line:</p>
<pre>const multiLineString = 'This is \
a multi-line \
string'; 
</pre>
<p>When the string is output on a single line:</p>
<pre>&gt;&nbsp; multiLineString
&lt;&nbsp;"This is a multi-line string"
</pre>
<p>Using ` backticks we can just write the multi-line string:</p>
<pre>const multiLineString = `This is 
a multi-line 
string`;
</pre>
<p>This might not seam like something that you'll want to do but sometimes we want a string that is a block of code:</p>
<pre>const myHTML = `
&lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;three&lt;/li&gt;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;
`;
</pre>
<p>This will return the multi-line string correctly:</p>
<pre>&gt; myHTML
&lt;&nbsp;"
&nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;one&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;two&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;three&lt;/li&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/ul&gt;&nbsp;
"&nbsp;</pre>
<h4 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h4>
<p>/ɪntəːpəˈleɪʃ(ə)n/<br><em>noun</em></p>
<ol>
    <li>the insertion of something of a different nature into something else.</li>
    <li>a remark interjected in a conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that we can inject other variables into our strings using the syntax <code>${myVariable}</code> . For example:</p>
<pre>const myName = `Dave`;
const myAge = 50;
const myHobby = `Coding`;
const sayDetails =`My name is ${myName} I am ${myAge} years old and my hobby is ${myHobby}.`;
</pre>
<p>Previously this had to be done breaking the string and using <code>+</code> plus to add in the variables and restarting the string:</p>
<pre>const myName = `Dave`;
const myAge = 50;
const myHobby = `Coding`;
const sayDetails = "My name is " + myName + "I am " + myAge + " years old and my hobby is " + myHobby + ".";
</pre>
<p>Both of these examples will output:</p>
<pre>My name is Dave I am 50 years old and my hobby is Coding.</pre>
<p>When injecting variables into strings using interpolation you can also perform maths on them. For example:</p>
<pre>const myName = `Dave`;
const myAge = 50;
const sayDogYears = `My name is ${myName} I am ${myAge} years old, although in dog years I would be ${myAge * 7} years old.`</pre>
<p>The output of sayDogYears would be:</p>
<pre>"My name is Dave I am 50 years old, although in dog years I would be 350 years old."</pre>

<h2>ESLint</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://eslint.org/" title="Fix JavaScript Code as you write">ESLint</a> with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code">VS Code</a> to check my code is valid while I write it, as probably many other do too.</p>
<p>I have created a config that changes <code>'</code> (single quotes) and <code>"</code> (double quotes) to <code>`</code> backticks.</p>
<p>This is done by editing the <code>.eslintrc</code> file in VS Code, a configuration file for the setting of ESLint:</p>
<pre> "rules": {
"quotes": [
"error",
"backtick"
]
</pre>
<p>This adds a rule for quotes, which returns either an <strong>error</strong> or <strong>warning</strong> and then has a setting of what to make sure the quotes are set to in this case a <strong>backtick</strong>.</p>
<p>To disable ESLint in a file you can just add a comment at the top of the JavaScript file:</p>
<pre>// eslint disable</pre>
<h3 id="issue">Issue</h3>
<p>Although there is an issue that at present I can't fix, so any help would be awesome.</p>
<p>If I have single quotes, when I save they are converted to backticks correctly. When I have double quotes, when I save they are converted to single quotes. Which means that I have to save twice to change double quotes into backticks.</p>
