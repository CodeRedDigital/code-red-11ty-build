  <p>As I learn more and more about JavaScript I realise that there is more and more that I don't know.</p>
  <p>Although I have realised that a great deal of what I am doing with JavaScript is examining data and doing stuff with that data.</p>
  <p>A great deal of that data is a list of things or an array.</p>
  <p>In JavaScript there are Methods, which are prebuilt bits of code for working with data, whether that data be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strings - words and numbers for example a person's name</li>
    <li>Numbers - for example the cost of something</li>
    <li>Boolean - true or false value for example an option is selected or not</li>
    <li>Array - a list of things for example a list of peoples names.</li>
    <li>Object -  a complex bit of related data for example a person, their first/last names, age, date of birth, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> An array can be a list of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects or a mixture of all of these.</p>

  <h2>Array.some()</h2>
  <p>This method allows you to check that a value appears in an array and will return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
  <p>Here I have a simple array of numbers.</p>
  <pre>
let simpleArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  </pre>
  <p>I can use the <code>.some()</code> method to check if a value appears in the array.</p>
  <pre>
simpleArray.some(2)
// returns true as 2 is in the array
simpleArray.some(7)
// returns false as 7 is not in the array
  </pre>
  <h3>Is a value in an Object in an array</h3>
  <p>Real life is usually a little more complex so let me explain why I am using this to give more context</p>
  <h4>Use Case</h4>
  <p>I have an id which I have got from the url:</p>
  <p><code>https://mysite.com/user/<strong>abc123</strong></code> id = abc123</p>
  <p>I have an array of users, my data:</p>
  <pre>
const users = [
  {
    id: "abc123",
    name: "Dave",
    age: 52
  },
  {
    id: "def456",
    name: "Tom",
    age: 36
  },
  {
    id: "ghi789",
    name: "Dick",
    age: 27
  }
]
  </pre>
  <p>Now I want to check to see if the id appears in the users array</p>
  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <pre>
users.some(user => user.id.includes(id))
  </pre>
  <p>This uses the <code>.some()</code> method and inside we have an arrow function that breaks each object in the array into a user.</p>
  <p>Then it looks in that user for an <code>id</code> (or <code>object key</code>) and then uses the <code>.includes()</code> string method to see if the <code>id</code> I got from the url is in the current user object that is being inspected.</p>
  <h4>How I am using this</h4>
  <p>So I am checking to see if the user exists in my array and if it is I am loading that into the page, if not I make an <code>API</code> call to get the user.</p>
  <pre>
if (users.some(user => user.id.includes(id))) {
  // load the user into the page
} else {
  // call function to get the user
  getUser(id);
  // load user into the page
}
  </pre>
